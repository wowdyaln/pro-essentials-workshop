## enum 看看就好
about enums, I think.
Maybe don't use them.

But if you do have to use them,
then don't use `const enums`, certainly.


## namespace 看看就好
I really can't see much functionality for them, to be honest. Namespaces, I think, are kind of like a dead feature in TypeScript. You will encounter them because they're used to organize types that are in the global scope, for instance, like the Node.js types contain a lot of namespaces.

**But in your application code, I would not advise using namespaces.**
